# Hashtables
A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys/value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array in which an element will be inserted or searched. By using a good hash function, hashing can work well. Under reasonable assumptions, the average time required to search for an element in a hash table is O(1).

## Challenge
Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency
For this approach, in order to deal with potential collisions, I've created a linkedlist function that will let duplicates of a key be stored as a linkedlist.
